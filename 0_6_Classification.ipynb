        "\n",
        "### What is Feature Scaling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature scaling is a method used to normalise a range of independent variables or features in a dataset. Feature scaling is also known as data normalisation and is performed during the data preprocessing stage (which is an iterative process where raw data is transformed and cleaned into a usable format). For example, if you have two independent variables with different ranges (ex. salary and age) you would want to apply feature scaling to these variables so they can all be on the same range (such as being centred around 0 or from 0-1). The type of range in which you want to place the data depends on the scaling technique used. The two most common feature scaling techniques are **normalisation and standardisation** which I will define below:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Normalisation (aka min-max scaling or min-max normalization)**: It is the simplest feature scaling method and rescales the independent variable feature range to [0,1].\n",
        "  * The general normalisation formula is given below (the **max(x)** and **min(x)** are the feature's maximum and minimum values):\n",
        "  $$\n",
        "  x'=\\dfrac{x-min(x)}{max(x)-min(x)}\n",
        "  $$\n",
        "  * If you would like to would like to specify your interval to be in any [a,b] range then you can specify the range using the formula below:\n",
        "  $$\n",
        "  x'=a+\\dfrac{(x-min(x))(b-a)}{max(x)-min(x)}\n",
        "  $$\n",
        "* **Standardisation (aka feature standardisation)**: Makes the data values, in each feature, have a mean of 0 and unit variance. The formula uses the features distributed mean and standard deviation and calculates the new data point with this formula ( $\\overline{x}$ is the average of the feature vector and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the feature vector):\n",
        "\n",
        " $$\n",
        " x’ = \\dfrac{x-\\overline{x}}{\\sigma}\n",
        " $$\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to use normalisation or standardisation?\n",
        "\n",
        "When building a machine learning pipeline it is important to consider whether you are going to normalise or standardise your dataset features. I have highlighted some situations when it is best to use each feature scaling method.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Normalisation**: Used when the data distribution does not follow the Gaussian distribution. It is also useful in algorithms that do not assume the data distribution like K-Nearest Neighbors (a classification algorithm which is under supervised learning). Another popular use case of normalisation is when an algorithm requires the data to be on a 0-1 scale. For example, in image processing it is essential to normalise the pixel intensity to fit within a certain range (the range of pixels is from 0-255 for the RGB colour range)\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Standardisation**: Used when the data follows a Gaussian Distribution (although this is not always the case). Since standardisation does not have a bounding range any outlets in the data will not be affected by standardisation. Standardisation is useful in clustering analysis (an unsupervised learning algorithm), to compare the similarities found between features based on certain distance measures. Another use case is during principal components analysis when individuals are interested in the components that maximise the data variance (something which min-max scaling does not present)\n",

Flattening the image transforms its dimension from 28 by 28 to 784 by 1. `input_shape=(28,28)` tells the flattened layer to only take in images that have an input shape of 28 by 28.

If you assign too many neurons in the layer you can overspecialize or your neural network could be slow to learn.

The ReLU activation function is commonly used in dense layers so the neurons don’t cancel each other out. For example, if we did not have the ReLU activation function and one neuron returns a value of 10 and the other returns a value of -10 then both values will cancel each other out. The ReLU activation function establishes a non-linear relationship between the layers which can help capture complex relationships between the layers.\n",

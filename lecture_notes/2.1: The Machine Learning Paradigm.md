* AI: machines that mimic human intelligence and human cognitive functions like problem-solving and learning
  * ML: a subset of AI that allows for optimization. When set up correctly, it helps you make predictions that minimize the errors that arise from merely guessing.
  * Deep Learning: subset of ML based on deep neural networks which automates much of the feature extraction piece of the process, eliminating some of the manual human intervention required.
* NLP: Using AI, ML, or DL to understand human language. (ex. speech to text conversion, reading a piece of text and interpreting it, and identifying the sentiment or emotion in text)
* Computer Vision: Using AI, ML or DL to understand visual information. (ex. image classification, object detection, action recognition in video, facial recognition)

In traditional programming, rules are implemented to the data and then a ouput is produced. In the machine learning paradigm, answers/outputs are given to the machine learning model which then defines the rules.

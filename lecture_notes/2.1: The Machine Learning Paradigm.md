* AI: machines that mimic human intelligence and human cognitive functions like problem-solving and learning
  * ML: a subset of AI that allows for optimization. When set up correctly, it helps you make predictions that minimize the errors that arise from merely guessing.
  * Deep Learning: subset of ML based on deep neural networks which automates much of the feature extraction piece of the process, eliminating some of the manual human intervention required.
* NLP: Using AI, ML, or DL to understand human language. (ex. speech to text conversion, reading a piece of text and interpreting it, and identifying the sentiment or emotion in text)
* Computer Vision: Using AI, ML or DL to understand visual information. (ex. image classification, object detection, action recognition in video, facial recognition)

In traditional programming, rules are implemented to the data and then a ouput is produced. In the machine learning paradigm, answers/outputs are given to the machine learning model which then defines the rules.

<ins> Video Notes </ins>

* The video talks about the general ML model/paradigm and how it differs from the traditional programing model
* ML can learn patterns from labeled data which removes the need to write down some of the rules through code 
* It appears that ML relies on probability, statistics, optimization, and linear algebra

The model/paradigm of traditional programming:
* Inputs: Rules and Data
* Outputs: Answers

One way to look at the ML model/paradigm:
* Inputs: Data Labels, Data
* Processer: Enhancement of the ML model through measuring loss
* Outputs: A ML model (set of rules/parameters)  

The ML model training process:
* Step 1: make a guess
* Step 2: measure accuracy
* Step 3: optimise guess
* Step 4: repeat process

A second way to look at the ML model/paradigm:
* Input: Data
* Processor: ML Model
* Output: Inferences
